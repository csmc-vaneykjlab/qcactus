QCactus is a C# desktop application for quickly consolidating QC metrics for proteomics data.  Please note this version is not our internal production version but rather a fun, messy community version.  Can't give everything away ;)

## Technical Requirements
This application is written in C# and intended to run as a Windows Desktop Application.
- .NET runtime (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)

- For Development:
